# Module-3-Assignment---Secure-Hashing-and-Encryption
The primary purpose of this code is to implement a logging system, manage file termination, and facilitate the encryption and decryption of text. Additionally, it simulates digital signatures while supporting two main roles: admin and user. The admin role grants full access, while the user role is limited in certain areas. There are specific passwords established for both roles, along with deciphering keys using the hash function SHA-256, which is managed through a text interface or comments within the code. 

The code includes a cipher that performs encryption and decryption based on a specified numeric shift, allowing for both numerical and alphabetical character shifts, while other characters remain unchanged. Presently, only the admin can utilize the simulated digital signature feature. The main menu provides distinct options for the two roles, with the admin enjoying complete access and the user having access to the cipher and SHA-256 functionalities. 

Key aspects of this code include user-friendly visual interactions and guided explanations for the cipher.
